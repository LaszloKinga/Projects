## About This Repository

This repository contains my university projects and my thesis.

Each folder represents a different project or assignment completed during my studies.  
A separate `README.md` file is included in each folder to provide more specific details about the contents.

The `Thesis` folder contains the full version of my final thesis.

The `SpringProject` project showcases my ability to develop multi-layered applications using Java, database technologies (JDBC & JPA), and both desktop and web-based UIs. It demonstrates an understanding of modular architecture, API design, and deployment processes using Gradle and Tomcat. Each module simulates realistic data handling and UI behavior, making it suitable for enterprise-level application development practice.
